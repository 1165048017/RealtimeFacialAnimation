# Realtime Facial Animation for Untrained User 

3rd Year Project/Dissertation. I created a Real time animation software capable of animating a 3D model of a face by only using a standard RGB webcam.

This was done in C++ with the libraries OpenGL 3.0 and OpenCV, for more detail read the attached dissertation.
